# Discord Rich Presence for Anki (AnkiDiscord)

### Description
This add-on will link Anki to Discord using Rich Presence.
It will show what you are currently doing on Anki (Main menu, browsing, adding or reviewing).
It will also show how many cards you have due and how long you've been on Anki for.

### Contributing/Issues
Please post issues on github and not on Anki's site.
Feel free to contact me if you have questions or wish to contribute.
